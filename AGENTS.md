# Improving Functionality and Visual Feedback in “Bobby” Pronunciation App

### Prompt

**Objective:**
Enhance the interactivity and user feedback of the application’s pronunciation practice workflow with more precise state distinction and clearer visual and textual cues.

**Required Improvements:**

1. **Distinct State Indicators**

   * When playing sound, display a **speaker icon** and use the existing color scheme for playback.
   * When recording, display a **record icon** (preferably a circular/red motif), again using the existing color scheme for recording.
   * Ensure there is **no ambiguity between playing and recording states**—icons and visual elements must be clearly differentiated.

2. **Sound Activity Bar**

   * Display a **horizontal bar** during both playback and recording.

     * The bar should visibly react to audio: animate or pulse according to sound activity.
     * The bar’s color must correspond to the current state—recording or playing (use existing color assignments).

3. **Detailed Textual Feedback**

   * Improve the text indicator for fine-grained feedback:

     * When connecting to the OpenAI API, indicate this status.
     * When playing audio, indicate explicitly that playback is active.
     * When recording, indicate that recording is underway.
     * When sending the audio file to the OpenAI API, show that upload/processing is in progress.
   * Status messages should update dynamically at each state change and provide clear, user-friendly descriptions.

4. **Threading and Responsiveness**

   * Review and revise the threading or asynchronous execution logic.

     * Ensure all UI updates remain responsive and free of blocking during API calls, playback, and recording.
     * Long-running or blocking operations (audio playback, recording, API interaction) should be performed in background threads or via asynchronous methods, with proper synchronization for UI updates.

5. **Color Palette**

   * Retain the current color choices for all UI elements; do not modify the palette, only enhance state indication and feedback.

**Instruction:**
Implement the above improvements so that the user always has an unambiguous and responsive understanding of whether the app is playing, recording, or interacting with the AI backend. All state transitions should be visually and textually distinct, with appropriate asynchronous handling.
